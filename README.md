# OSRS-Flipper
In the game "Old School Runescape" you can buy and sell items with other players using something called the "Grand Exchange".
This flipper exists to take advantage of the margins between different items in the game.
For each item, the buy and sell price will sometimes differ because some people will either sell higher than others are buying for, or vice verse.
So, people can buy items at a lower price, and then sell them at a higer price to make a profit, or ROI.
This particular flipper sorts out lower volume items, because those can be particular volatile and inconsistent to trade.
In the future, I'd like to implement a way for the user to adjust the item volume on their own and to take into account the recently introduced tax added to all trades.
